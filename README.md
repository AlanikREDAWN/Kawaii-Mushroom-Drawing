# Kawaii-Mushroom-Drawing

This drawing is a drawing I made for Hack Club's Arcade. I referenced a book I got from my local library called Kawaii Doodle World by Zainab Khan. Once I made the drawing, I made it my own by digitizing it and adding color, so it's a fully fleshed scene with some personality! Here's a picture of the final drawing, and beneath it, a timelapse of the digitizing process:
